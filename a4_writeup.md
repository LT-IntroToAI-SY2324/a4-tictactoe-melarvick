# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
Creating the board was the most difficult part of the game for me because it was hard to understand how to list and format everything correctly. 

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
You could program a computer to randomly select x or o and place it on the board in competition with the other player and making sure the computer choses a new spot that hasn't been chosen every time. 

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
You could somehow have the computer learn from the player's moves/anticipate the patters that they make to block them during the next round.
